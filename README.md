**AI-Powered Circular Economy for Solar Panel Recycling**

## Overview
SolarVortex is an AI-driven platform designed to tackle the growing challenge of solar panel waste management. With solar capacity projected to reach **1700 GW by 2050**, millions of tonnes of end-of-life panels will accumulate without efficient recycling methods.

Our solution leverages **computer vision, predictive analytics, and circular economy frameworks** to enable:
- Automated solar panel classification and recyclability grading
- Optimized logistics and transportation planning
- Interactive material flow visualizations
- Integrated lifecycle management for panels

By combining AI, data visualization, and logistics optimization, SolarVortex reduces costs, increases material recovery, and prevents toxic waste from harming communities and ecosystems.
